# Product Sales Analysis Pens Printers

### üìç Overview

This case study is based on Datacamp‚Äôs practical exam project that earned me my Data Analyst Professional certification. For this project, I was tasked to analyze data from the sales team of Pens and Printers fictional company.

Pens and Printers is a company that provides high-quality office products to large organizations. They provide everything from pens and notebooks to desk chairs and monitors. They don‚Äôt produce their products but sell those made by other companies.

Their focus has been on selling products to enable our customers to be more creative and focused on tools for brainstorming. Recently they launched a **new line of office stationery**, and they have tested **three different sales strategies** for this, targeted email and phone calls, as well as combining the two.

* **Email:** Customers received an email when the product line was launched, and a further email three weeks later. This required very little work for the team.

* **Call:** Customers were called by a member of the sales team. On average members of the team were on the phone for around **thirty minutes** per customer.

* **Email and call:** Customers were first sent the product information email, then called a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product may support their work. The email required little work from the team, the call was around **ten minutes** per customer.

### üéØ Objectives

The executive team needed an update on sales approaches for the newly launched product line and they needed this information as soon as possible.

They wanted to know:

* How many customers were there for each approach?
* What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
* Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
* Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us to use if the results are similar.

They don‚Äôt know if there are other differences between the customers in each group, so they wanted to see what I could tell them that could be helpful about that from the data.
