    "Pens and Printers, founded in 1984, provides high-quality office products to large organizations. They are a trusted supplier of items ranging from pens and notebooks to desk chairs and monitors, selling products made by other companies rather than producing their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Pens and Printers launched a new office stationery line and are adapting their sales strategies to ensure effective promotion. Launching a new product line is costly, so they have tested three sales approachesâ€”email, phone, and a combination of bothâ€”to quickly determine the most effective method.\n",

    "Over the last six weeks, Email was used most widely (**49.8%**), while call-based methods were more limited due to resource intensity. The Call method accounted for about one-third (**33.1%**) of customers, while the combined **Email + Call** method reached the smallest segment of the customers (**17.1%**).\n",

    "\n",
    "Both the histogram and boxplot show that overall revenue across all methods is right-skewed, reflecting distinct customer spending patterns. The median revenue is **90 USD**, lower than the mean of  **96 USD**, due to a small number of high-spending customers (top 10% exceed **183 USD**). Most customers generate between **53 USD** and **108 USD**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The boxplots illustrate distinct revenue patterns, indicating that customer responses vary significantly depending on the sales method used. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Email + Call approach clearly outperforms the others, delivering the highest typical revenue per customer at **184â€¯USD**, with values reaching up to **238â€¯USD**. While it shows greater variability, this method demonstrates strong potential and is well-suited for **selective targeting of high-value customers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Email method generated a median revenue of **96â€¯USD** per customer, with **consistently reliable results**â€”most customers spent between **88â€¯USD** (25th percentile) and **105â€¯USD** (75th percentile).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, the Call method delivered the lowest returns, with a median revenue of just **49â€¯USD** per customer, highlighting its limited effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns suggest that while the **Email + Call** method drives the highest revenue from high-value customers, its limited use (17% of customers) points to **targeted potential rather than broad scalability**. The **Email-only** method provides **strong and consistent performance** with minimal effort, making it ideal for wide-scale outreach. In contrast, the **Call-only** approach delivers the **lowest returns** despite requiring the most team resources, indicating it is the **least effective strategy** overall.\n",

    "\n",
    "Customer distribution is concentrated in a few key statesâ€”California (12.5%), Texas (7.9%), New York (6.4%), and Florida (6.0%)â€”which together make up over 32% of customers. This distribution closely mirrors the overall population spread across the United States, highlighting natural regional market priorities. \n",

    "Median revenue does not significantly vary by state, indicating consistent customer value nationwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "![5_hist_state](5_hist_state.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customer Engagement Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer engagement**, measured by the number of site visits in the last 6 months, showed a **modest positive correlation** with revenue (**r = 0.33**), suggesting that more engaged customers may spend slightly more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the **sales method**  is by far the strongest determinant of revenue differences. The variation in revenue between methods is far more significant than differences caused by loyalty, state or engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "While engagement alone is not a strong predictor, it may still provide **strategic value** for **future targeting and personalization efforts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Metrics \n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively track and optimize sales performance across methods, I recommend monitoring three business metrics weekly (based on median values):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Revenue per Customer**: will highlight which approach generates the greatest revenue impact;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Units Sold per Customer**: will uncover customer purchasing depth and identify upselling opportunities;\n",
    "    \n",
    "       \n",
    "3. **Revenue per Unit Sold**: will assess the value of each transaction, revealing whether methods drive higher-value purchases through premium products;\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these metrics balance efficiency and effectiveness, providing a clear, data-driven basis for adjusting sales tactics and allocating resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a snapshot of current performance based on median values for each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Sales Method** | **Revenue per Customer** | **Units Sold per Customer** | **Revenue per Unit** |\n",
    "|------------------|:------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n",
    "| Call             | $49                      | 10                           | $5                    |\n",
    "| Email            | $96                      | 10                           | $10                   |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers reached through the **Email + Call** approach purchased more units (**12 units**, median) and generated the **highest revenue per unit** (15 USD), indicating they may be buying either **higher-priced products** or **larger quantities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Email-only** method shows solid performance: it matches the Call method in units sold (10) but nearly **doubles the revenue per unit**, making it a **highly cost-effective and scalable strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the **Call-only** method delivers the lowest revenue per customer and per unit, despite similar units sold. This suggests **lower transaction value** or **reduced effectiveness** in influencing purchases, especially when considering its higher time and resource cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, the following strategic recommendations aim to **maximize sales performance** and **optimize resource allocation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discontinue Call-Only Method**:\n",
    "Requires 30 minutes per customer, yet delivers the lowest revenue. Reallocating those team resources will bolster higher-return methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prioritize Email + Call for High-Potential Customers**:\n",
    "As it delivers the **highest revenue** per customer and per unit with **moderate effort** (10 minutes per customer).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Email for Broad Outreach**:\n",
    "Leverage the Email-only method for broad outreach, as it is a **scalable strategy** providing **solid returns with minimal effort**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invest in Engagement**:\n",
    "Revenue increases modestly with customer site visits. Drive engagement through targeted campaigns, newsletters, or promotions to support sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitor Business Metrics weekly**:\n",
    "Track the three key metrics weeklyâ€”**revenue per customer, units sold per customer, and revenue per unit**â€”to evaluate ongoing performance and guide timely adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve Data Quality and Collection**:\n",
    "by implementing mandatory revenue entry validation to reduce missing values below 1%, ensuring cleaner data for forecasting and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aligning sales methods with customer value and resource availability will enable the company to **balance revenue growth with operational efficiency effectively**.\n",
